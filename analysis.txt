Big O Notation


Task 0: 

        O(1)
The execution time is independent of the input data.


Task 1: 

        O(n)
The execution time is directly proportional to the input data.


Task 2: 

        O(n)
The execution time is directly proportional to the input data.


Task 3: 

    Part A:     O(n log n)
The execution time for part of the code is directly proportional to the input data.
The sort function has a complexity of O(n log n)

    Part B:     O(n)
The execution time is directly proportional to the input data. 


Task 4:

        O(n log n)
The execution time for part of the code is directly proportional to the input data.
The sort function has a complexity of O(n log n)
